This is my first github upload, so i may not have uploaded things correctly. Program should be run from main.py and pygame & python must be installed. Compiled program is above github allowed file size so i cant upload it here.

For full application (without source code), please use this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tPWaqWmhVxZvONCgV-ZyTLKw6vNsn_tT/view?usp=drive_link
